# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Firesafe Sealant EX is a fire-retardant, heat-expanding graphite sealant. The sealant reacts to heat and begins to expand at 150 °C. It expands more than 13 times its original volume after 30 minutes at 550 °C with 5 bar pressure. The sealant seals combustible penetrations and cavities within a few minutes.

# APPLICATION AREAS
Firesafe EX is primarily used as fire-resistant penetration sealing in masonry/cast or gypsum board constructions together with backing of mineral wool/rock wool or polystyrene, as well as sealing of joints and gaps.

Used for sealing the following penetrations:
- Single plastic pipes made of PVC, PP, PE
- Single or larger bundles of electrical conduits/VP pipes
- Single or larger bundles of cables
- Single metal pipes insulated with combustible PU insulation or fire-rated mineral wool insulation, as well as smaller metal pipes in bundles

# APPLICATION
Openings to be sealed must be free of dust and grease. For absorbent materials such as Siporex, lightweight concrete, and similar, it is recommended to prime before sealing. Mix 1 part sealant with 2 parts water to create a primer. Apply the finished primer with a brush or spray bottle. Allow the primer to dry for 30 minutes. Firesafe Sealant EX should not be applied at temperatures below +5 ºC. The sealing is done using a cartridge gun and standard sealing tools. Tools are cleaned with water.

# DRYING TIME
At a minimum temperature of +23 °C and a relative humidity of max 50 %, the following guidelines apply:
- Skin formation after approximately 15 minutes
- Curing time is approximately 1-2 mm per 24 hours, depending on the applied thickness

# PACKAGING
Plastic cartridge for standard cartridge gun – content 310 ml. Delivered in a box of 24 cartridges.

# STORAGE/SHELF LIFE
Store in a dry and frost-free environment. Shelf life is 12 months.

# SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
The sealant is solvent-free and environmentally friendly. It has no known irritating effects upon skin contact, but avoid contact with eyes or mouth. Uncured material should be kept away from children and animals.
