## General Description

### FIRESAFE GPG MORTAR

GPG is a powder composed of gypsum, perlite, and fiberglass that, when mixed with water, becomes a white fire-resistant sealing compound with either a liquid or stiff consistency. GPG is a gypsum-based, fast-curing fire-sealing compound with good mechanical strength and excellent sound insulation. GPG has good thermal conductivity, even in small thicknesses around all technical installations, which makes it effective in insulating against heat exposure. GPG expands during curing and adheres well to all building materials. GPG is primarily used for fire-sealing large or small holes and openings around technical installations, as well as empty recesses in walls, floors, and ceilings made of masonry/cast or gypsum board constructions with fire resistance up to EI 240 minutes, with thicknesses as specified in the product documentation.

The product’s application area is category Z2; indoors with air humidity lower than 85% RH, temperature not below 0°C, protected from rain and UV radiation.

### INSTALLATION

GPG is added to a bucket with a little water at the bottom, and the mixture is blended with masonry tools or whisked for about ½ minute with a drill to achieve a smooth mixture with the desired consistency. The initial curing time according to NS-EN 480-2 is 75 minutes but may vary depending on the mixing ratio between water and GPG. FS retarder can be added to delay the curing time. A stiff mixture is made with 4 parts GPG and 1 part water. A liquid mixture is made with 2 parts GPG and 1 part water.

Recesses must be cleaned of dust and dirt before fire-sealing. Metal pipes should always be rust-protected before sealing is carried out. It is recommended to tape around recesses with masking tape for a neat final result.

The GPG mixture is installed according to the tables for the relevant fire resistance, construction, and installations shown in this installation guide.

**For fire-sealing of hollow-core slab elements, the solution is specified in Building Detail 520.342 – October 2014, section 25.**

Alternatively, the penetration can be sealed on the top and bottom of the slab element. The flanges of the element must then be at least the same thickness as the fire-sealing compound to achieve the required fire resistance.

### CORROSION PROTECTION

When fire-sealing around uninsulated metallic pipes, it is important to ensure that the pipes have adequate corrosion protection for the specific environment they are installed in. This is because moisture/condensation can more easily occur in and around a fire seal. The plumber is normally responsible for the corrosion protection.

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Firesafe GPG meets the requirements of GEV and the results comply with EMICODE class EC 1PLUS. The product also meets the requirements of the ISO 16000 based M1 classification. There are no health or safety risks.

### STORAGE

Store in a dry, frost-free environment. The storage period is virtually unlimited.
